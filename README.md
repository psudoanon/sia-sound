#SiaSound Player:

SiaSound Player is a progressive web application which allows for the sharing of mp3s hosted on the Sia network

It consists of a frontend (the single page PWA) which accepts allows for both online & offline playback of MP3 files uploaded to the Sia Network and a backend which is responsible for uploading files to the Sia Network and keeping track of a "recently uploaded" list 

Users can share links to specific songs with their friends and each client will have their own offline cache of music they have listened to off of the Sia Network
